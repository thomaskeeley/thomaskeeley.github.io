		<center><h1>GDP Findings</h1></center>
		<center><p>
			The United States GDP is well beyond most of the major countries
			in the world and shows a consistent upward trend from 2010-2016.
			China displays a significant climbing trend and nearing the United States.
			Relative to the GDP, the total government expenditures is consistent with 
			the GDP as the United States spends twice as much as the second leading country.		
		</p></center>
		<center><h1>Military Findings</h1></center>
		<center><p>
			Unsurprisingly, the military spending levels are partially consistent with
			the overall spending levels. However, Saudi Arabia is introduced into the analysis
			with high levels of military spending. When examining military spending relative
			to total government spending, Saudi Arabia is significantly higher with more than
			25% of total expenditures going towards military spending. Though the United States
			has the highest level of total military spending, the U.S. only dedicates around 10%
			of total expenses. This is further reflected in examining military spending as a percentage
			of GDP. Nearly 10% of Saudi Arabia's GDP is attributed to military spending.
		</p></center>
		<center><h1>Education Findings</h1></center>
		<center><p>
			Education spending levels are examined as a percentage of total spending. Displayed 
			the top 12 countries in education spending between 2010-2016.
			Brazil displays the highest level of education spending as a percentage of 
			total government spending at slightly about 15%. This is over three times what
			is spent on military expenditures. The United States is third highest in relative
			education spending. The level of education spending is just slightly higher than
			that of military spending but both are consistent with each other at about 10%.
			India and Russia are the only two countries in this group to have higher levels of 
			military spending than education, though India is only slightly higher. Russia, however,
			has a rate of military spending that is over double that of education spending. When examining
			the per person spending relative the the total GDP per person, the United States displays
			the highest rates of education spending with Germany closely behing. 
			Relative to GDP, India's rate of education spending is significantly lower than 
			many of the other major countries. Many of the top trending countries in education
			spending are smaller countries. Though there is a collection of trending education
			spending in the Central Asia region.
		</p></center>
		<center><h1>Healthcare Findings</h1></center>
		<center><p>
			Healthcare spending is examined as a percentage of the GDP in the 2010-2016 timerange.
			The United States is again at the top of spending rates when it comes to healthcare.
			Though there is a slightly different relationship to military spending with a rate of 
			healthcare spending well over three times that of military spending. This rate is of
			education spending to military spending is considerably consistent with the other major
			countries except for Saudi Arabia. Saudi Arabia spending on military accounts for nearly
			double of the GDP compared to healthcare spending. The United States displays a very 
			high ratio of healthcare spending to per person GDP rates relative to the other major
			countries and India is again at the bottom of this group with lower levels of per person
			spending on healthcare. The top trending countries in healthcare spending display
			less of a geographic pattern than that of education spending. Brazil, Sweden and Saudi Arabia
			are all major countries that are displaying an upward trend in healthcare spending with
			other geographically smaller countries such as Sierra Leone and Marshall Islands displaying
			the highest upward trending rates on healthcare spending. 
		</p></center>
		<center><h1>Overall Findings</h1></center>
		<center><p>
			Country level data for military, education, and healthcare is inconistent throughout
			various sources. The variables for this type of data varies across particular data sources
			and it is difficult to analyze with 100% confidence as there are often missing values for 
			certain variables and missing data altogether for particular countries. The analysis conducted
			for this project collated data from different sources and calculated at different levels to
			produce the graphics seen in this presentation. In order to analyze the data despite the missing
			values, the average values were calculated in the 2010-2016 range. This value was often used
			to display the country level trends for the spending categories. Much of the data preprocessing
			was done using excel. The first variable examined examined was military spending. For the purpose
			of this project moving forward, the top 10-15 countries from military spending were examined
			with regard to other spending variables. With these countries in mind, the values for the other
			spending variables were merged to produce country spending statistics across the various data sources.
			Much of bandwidth for this project was spent on data acquisition and preprocessing which is common for
			most data science related projects. The trends identified throughout the analysis are consistent with 
			world thought and understanding of country level spending. The United States displays the highest levels
			of spending as the country is the leader in global GDP. However, the United States is also a little more
			balanced in terms of overall spending. Saudi Arabia displays a high level of military spending and does not
			even appear in the top 15 for education spending. Relative to other spending levels, Saudi Arabia spends significantly
			more on military than health and education. China is the only other country that is relatively close to the 
			United States in GDP and is displaying a steady upward trend in expenditures and GDP. Many of the upward
			trending countries in terms of education and health spending are smaller countries that may average between
			1-3% growth in 2010-2016. Overall, the spending levels for some of the largest countries are somewhat consistent
			with conventional thought, though there are some trends that set certain countries apart when it comes to distribution
			of spending.
